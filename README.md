# Deep Learning in Genomics Primer
Tutorial on building a convolutional neural net to discover DNA-binding motifs.

This ipython notebook is based on the tutorial that sumpliments the manuscript, **A Primer on Deep Learning in Genomics** (*Nature Genetics, 2018*) by James Zou, Mikael Huss, Abubakar Abid, Pejman Mohammadi, Ali Torkamani & Amalio Telentil. [Read the accompanying paper here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0295-5).

In this version, I have edited some text in order to hopefully provide a more consise explination of some topics and I have tweaked some code to provide a greater accuracy, mainly adding dropouts and early stopping. 

Please refer to the [original paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0295-5) for all credit and further reading.
